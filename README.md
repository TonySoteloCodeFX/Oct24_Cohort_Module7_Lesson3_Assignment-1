<h4>Task 2: Utilizing Number Input</h4>

- Build a web form with a number input field.
<br>

- Add a label and placeholder text to instruct users to enter a quantity.
<br>

- Use HTML5 attributes to define the minimum and maximum values accepted for this input.
<br>

- Include step attributes for incrementing or decrementing the value.
<br>

- Implement a submit button for users to submit their chosen quantity.
<br>

<b>Expected Outcomes:</b> Students should be able to create a number input field with specified constraints and step increments.

<h4>Task 3: Employing Date Input</h4>

- Create an HTML form that includes a date input field.
<br>

- Add a label and placeholder text to indicate that users should select a date.
<br>

- Utilize HTML5 attributes to set the minimum and maximum values for the range.
<br>

- Display the current value of the range to users.
<br>

- Add a submit button for users to submit their chosen value.

<b>Expected Outcomes:</b> Students should be able to create a range input field, set its constraints, and display the current value to users.

<h4>Task 5 (BONUS): Capturing Color with Color Input</h4>

- Build an HTML form featuring a color input field.

<h2><i>2. Building a Comprehensive Web Form</i></h2>

<b>Objective:</b> The objective of this assignment is to give students the opportunity to add to their multi-element web form by incorporating various form elements, including radio buttons, checkboxes, and select menus. Students will also practice implementing form validation and improving accessibility.

<h4>Task 1: Creating a Selection Experience</h4>

- Now let's add some different selection features to your form to spice things up.
<br>

- Include a select menu that allows users to choose their favorite programming language from a list of options.
<br>

- Implement a set of radio buttons for users to indicate their level of expertise (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
<br>

- Add checkboxes to let users select their preferred development platforms (web, mobile, desktop).
<br>

<b>Expected Outcomes:</b> Students should be able to create a selection experience with select menus, radio buttons, and checkboxes to capture user preferences.

<h4>Task 2: Improving Accessibility</h4>

- Ensure that all form elements have associated labels using the for attribute.
<br>

- Implement ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility for users with disabilities.
<br>

- Test the form with screen readers to verify that it provides a user-friendly experience.
<br>

<b>Expected Outcomes:</b> Students should be able to enhance the accessibility of the web form by associating labels with form elements and implementing ARIA attributes.
